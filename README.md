# TypeScript Battlesnake
Originally based off of the official Battlesnake TypeScript snake: https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/starter-snake-typescript
In addition to the standard Battlesnake endpoints (/ & /move), I have added /stats, which prints the results given by the Tokei library.

## Battlesnake Profile
My Battlesnake profile is located here: https://play.battlesnake.com/profile/waryferryman. The Rust one is in its infancy, Jagwire/Jaguar are good snakes!
